# WiFi backscatter simulator
This is a simulator platform that imitates WiFi packets to enable performance evaluation of WiFi backscatter systems. The researcher may tune multiple features of the packets and estimate what portion of packets get corrupted in that scenario. For example, the following figure is based on this simulator numbers:
